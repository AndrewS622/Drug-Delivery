# Drug-Delivery
ES 221 at Harvard University

Engineering Sciences 221 is a graduate-level course covering relevant topics in the entire drug discovery pipeline, ranging from initial discovery to structural characterization, formulation, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and clinical trials. Drug delivery systems studied including intravenous, oral, and injectables. Simple simulations and data analysis were performed in Matlab as part of the problem sets and are reproduced here. These cover topics as follows: 

1. Water Solubility, Critical Micelle Concentration, Bolus and Zero-Order Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
2. Water Solubility as a Function of pH, Bolus Pharmacokinetics, AUC, Pharmacodynamics, and Bioavailability of Antipsychotics
3. Extended-Release Polymer Formulations, In Vitro Release Kinetics, and Pharmacokinetics
4. Antibody-Drug Conjugates: Target Selection, Antibody Selection, FcRn Binding Domain Optimization, Antibody-Toxin Linker Optimization, and Maximum Tolerated Dose Estimation
